Consider an array/list of sheep where some sheep may be missing from their place. We need a function that counts the number of sheep present in the array (true means present).

For example,

function countSheeps(arrayOfSheep) {
  return arrayOfSheep.filter((n)=>{return n === true}).length;
}

----function countSheeps(arrayOfSheeps) {
    return arrayOfSheeps.filter(Boolean).length;
  }
