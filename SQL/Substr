It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

-- # write your SQL statement here:
--you are given a table 'removechar'
--with column 's', return a table with 
--column 's' and your result in a column 
--named 'res'.

>select s,
substr(substr(s,2),1,length(s)-2)
as res 
from removechar 
where length(s)>1;

>SELECT s, SUBSTRING(s, 2, LENGTH(s) - 2) AS res 
FROM removechar

>SELECT s, CASE length(s) >= 2
            WHEN true THEN right(left(s, -1), -1)
            ELSE s
          END AS res
FROM removechar;
